Data on **air quality in Russian cities and settlements** covered by the state air monitoring 
network. In 2021, Roshydromet conducted regular observations at 620 stations in 221 cities.

The unit of observation is settlement where air quality 
was monitored in a particular year. Data for each observation are given by such 
attributes as region and settlement names and their OKTMO codes, the general level 
of air pollution, emissions from industrial enterprises for certain classes 
of substances, the population and the number of the monitoring stations.

Dataset is available for work in CSV format (encoding: «UTF-8», column separator: «;»).
